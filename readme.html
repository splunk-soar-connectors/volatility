<p>Each of the actions take in an optional parameter called 'profile'. In the absence of this parameter the app will try to find the profile to use by executing the 'imageinfo' command. The downside is that actions will take longer time to execute since the memory dump file will require to be loaded twice, once to get the profile and the next time to actually run the action.</p>
